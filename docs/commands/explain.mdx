description: "Preview what each editor will receive"
---

```bash
devw explain
```

Shows what rules each configured editor will receive, without writing any files. A semantic dry-run.

## Output

For each configured tool, explain shows:

- **Output path** and mode (markers or full file)
- **Rules included**, grouped by scope with counts
- **Rules excluded** with reasons (severity `info` or `enabled: false`)
- For Windsurf: output size vs 6,000 character limit

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--tool claude` | Explain only a specific tool |

## Example

```bash
devw explain --tool claude
```

```
