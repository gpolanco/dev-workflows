A bridge is an adapter that translates your rules into the format a specific AI editor expects. Each bridge is a single file that implements the same interface.

## How It Works

```
.dwf/rules/ (YAML) → Bridge → Editor config file
```

Bridges **only translate format**. They don't add new rules, logic, or intent.

## Available Bridges

### Claude Code

**Output:** `CLAUDE.md` at project root

Rules are grouped by scope as H2 sections, each rule as a bullet point. Content wrapped in `<!-- BEGIN/END dev-workflows -->` markers.

### Cursor

**Output:** `.cursor/rules/devworkflows.mdc`

Includes MDC frontmatter with `alwaysApply: true`. Same scope grouping as Claude.

### Gemini CLI

**Output:** `GEMINI.md` at project root

Identical format to Claude Code. Gemini CLI consumes `GEMINI.md` with the same markdown format.

## Adding More Bridges

The bridge interface is simple. Each bridge defines an `id`, `outputPaths`, and a `compile()` function that takes rules and config and returns a `Map<filePath, content>`.

New bridges will be added in future versions (Windsurf, Copilot, Aider).
