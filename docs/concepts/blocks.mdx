description: "Blocks have been replaced by the rules registry"

<Warning>
  Blocks have been replaced by pulled rules from the GitHub registry. Use `devw add <category>/<rule>` instead.
</Warning>

## Migration

The block system (`devw add typescript-strict`) has been replaced by the rules registry (`devw add typescript/strict`).

### What changed

| Before (blocks) | After (rules registry) |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| `devw add typescript-strict` | `devw add typescript/strict` |
| `devw add --list` (local blocks) | `devw add --list` (from GitHub) |
| `devw remove typescript-strict` | `devw remove typescript/strict` |
| `devw list blocks` | `devw list rules` |
| Rules embedded in npm package | Rules fetched from GitHub |

### How to migrate

1. Remove old blocks: `devw remove <block-name>` (if still in config)
2. Add the equivalent rule: `devw add <category>/<rule>`
3. Run `devw compile` to regenerate output files

## Browse available rules

```bash
# List all available rules from the registry
devw add --list

# Interactive mode — browse categories and select
devw add
```

See [devw add](/commands/add) for full documentation.
