title: "Output Modes"
description: "Copy mode vs link mode, and how markers protect your content"
---

dev-workflows supports two output modes, configured during `devw init` or in `.dwf/config.yml`.

## Copy Mode (default)

```yaml
mode: copy
```

Writes compiled content directly into the target files. This is the simplest and recommended mode.

## Link Mode

```yaml
mode: link
```

Writes compiled files to `.dwf/.cache/` and creates symlinks from the expected output paths. Useful if you want a single source of truth without duplicating content.

When using link mode, `.dwf/.cache/` is automatically added to `.gitignore`.

## Markers

When compiling to CLAUDE.md or GEMINI.md, the generated content is wrapped in markers:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN dev-workflows -->
# Project Rules

## Conventions

- Always use named exports.

<!-- END dev-workflows -->
```

If you have **manual content** outside the markers, it is preserved on recompile. This lets you keep hand-written rules alongside generated ones.

## Which bridges use markers?

Not all bridges use BEGIN/END markers. It depends on whether the output file is shared with other content:

| Bridge | Output | Markers | Why |
|--------|--------|---------|-----|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | Yes | File may contain manual rules |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` | Yes | File may contain manual rules |
| VS Code / Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Yes | File is shared with other tools |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/devworkflows.mdc` | No | File is fully managed by devw |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/rules/devworkflows.md` | No | File is fully managed by devw |

Files without markers are **completely overwritten** on each compile. Do not add manual content to these files — it will be lost.
