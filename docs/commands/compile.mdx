```bash
devw compile
```

Reads your `.dwf/` rules and generates output for each configured tool using the appropriate bridge.

## Output by Tool

| Tool | Output File |
|------|-------------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/devworkflows.mdc` |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` |

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--tool claude` | Compile only a specific bridge |
| `--dry-run` | Show output without writing files |
| `--verbose` | Show detailed output |

## Markers

When compiling to markdown-based outputs (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md), the generated content is wrapped in `<!-- BEGIN dev-workflows -->` and `<!-- END dev-workflows -->` markers.

This means you can have **manual content** in your CLAUDE.md and dev-workflows will only replace the section between markers. Your hand-written rules are preserved.

## Examples

```bash
# Compile all configured tools
devw compile

# Preview output without writing
devw compile --dry-run

# Compile only Claude bridge
devw compile --tool claude
```
