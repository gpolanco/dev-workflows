```bash
devw add [category/rule]
```

Adds rules from the official dev-workflows registry. Supports both interactive and direct modes.

## Interactive Mode

Running `devw add` without arguments launches an interactive flow:

1. Browse categories from the registry
2. Select rules to install (with back navigation)
3. Optionally add rules from multiple categories
4. Review a summary and confirm
5. Rules are downloaded, converted to YAML, and compiled

Rules already installed are shown with an `(already installed)` indicator.

## Direct Mode

```bash
devw add typescript/strict
```

Downloads and installs a specific rule by path. If the rule already exists at the same version, reports "Already up to date".

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--list [category]` | List available rules from the registry |
| `--no-compile` | Skip auto-compile after adding |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing rules without asking |
| `--dry-run` | Show output without writing files |

## Examples

```bash
# Interactive — browse and select rules
devw add

# Install a specific rule
devw add typescript/strict

# List all available rules
devw add --list

# Preview what would be written
devw add javascript/react --dry-run

# Force overwrite without confirmation
devw add css/tailwind --force
```

## Available Rules

Rules are organized by category. Run `devw add --list` for the latest list.
