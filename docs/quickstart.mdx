## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22

## Install and Initialize

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize your project">
    ```bash
    npx dev-workflows init
    ```
    This creates a `.dwf/` directory with `config.yml` and empty rule files for each scope: architecture, conventions, security, testing, and workflow.

    The CLI detects existing AI tools in your project (CLAUDE.md, .cursor/, GEMINI.md, .windsurf/, .github/copilot-instructions.md) and pre-selects them.

    **With a preset** — bootstrap a full spec-driven workflow in one command:
    ```bash
    npx dev-workflows init --preset spec-driven -y
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add rules from the registry (optional)">
    ```bash
    npx dev-workflows add typescript/strict
    ```
    Installs rules from the GitHub registry into your `.dwf/rules/` directory. Run `devw add --list` to see all available rules, or `devw add` for interactive selection.

    You can also install slash commands, templates, and hooks:
    ```bash
    devw add command/spec         # slash command
    devw add template/feature-spec # spec template
    devw add hook/auto-format      # editor hook
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compile">
    ```bash
    npx dev-workflows compile
    ```
    Generates editor-specific config files and deploys assets:

    | Tool | Output |
    |------|--------|
    | Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
    | Cursor | `.cursor/rules/devworkflows.mdc` |
    | Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` |
    | Windsurf | `.windsurf/rules/devworkflows.md` |
    | VS Code Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |

    Assets are also deployed:

    | Asset Type | Output |
    |------------|--------|
    | Commands | `.claude/commands/*.md` |
    | Templates | `docs/specs/*.md` |
    | Hooks | `.claude/settings.local.json` |
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What's Next

- Write your own rules in `.dwf/rules/` → [Rules format](/concepts/rules)
- Learn about assets (commands, templates, hooks) → [Assets](/concepts/assets)
- Validate your setup → `devw doctor`
- Browse all commands → [Commands](/commands/init)
