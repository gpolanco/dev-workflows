```bash
devw remove [category/rule]
```

Removes a rule that was installed via `devw add` and recompiles.

## Interactive Mode

Running `devw remove` without arguments shows installed rules and lets you select which to remove.

## Direct Mode

```bash
devw remove typescript/strict
```

Removes the rule file (`pulled-typescript-strict.yml`) and updates `config.yml`.

## Examples

```bash
# Remove a specific rule
devw remove typescript/strict

# Interactive — select rules to remove
devw remove
```

Rules added manually (not via `devw add`) are not affected.
