Blocks are curated collections of rules that you can install instead of writing from scratch. Each block targets a specific technology or concern.

## Install a Block

```bash
devw add typescript-strict
```

This merges the block's rules into your `.dwf/rules/` files by scope and runs `devw compile` automatically.

## Available Blocks

### typescript-strict

Strict TypeScript conventions for professional codebases.

**Rules:**
- `ts-strict-no-any` — Never use `any`. Use `unknown` + type guards.
- `ts-strict-explicit-returns` — Explicit return types on exported functions.
- `ts-strict-no-enums` — Prefer union types over enums. Use `as const`.
- `ts-strict-no-non-null-assertion` — Never use `!`. Handle null explicitly.

### react-conventions

React component and hooks patterns.

**Rules:**
- `react-fc-declaration` — Use function declarations for components.
- `react-hooks-rules` — Follow Rules of Hooks. Custom hooks start with `use`.
- `react-prop-types` — Use TypeScript interfaces for props, not PropTypes.
- `react-no-inline-styles` — No inline styles. Use Tailwind or CSS modules.

### nextjs-approuter

Next.js App Router patterns and best practices.

**Rules:**
- `next-server-components` — Default to Server Components. Add `'use client'` only when needed.
- `next-server-actions` — Use Server Actions for mutations. Validate inputs with Zod.
- `next-route-handlers` — Use route handlers for API endpoints. Export named HTTP methods.
- `next-metadata` — Export `metadata` or `generateMetadata` in layout/page files.

### tailwind

Utility-first CSS with Tailwind.

**Rules:**
- `tw-utility-first` — Use Tailwind utilities. Avoid custom CSS.
- `tw-no-arbitrary` — Minimize arbitrary values. Extend theme config instead.
- `tw-component-extraction` — Extract repeated utility patterns into components, not CSS.

### testing-basics

Testing fundamentals and conventions.

**Rules:**
- `test-naming` — Test names describe behavior: "should [verb] when [condition]".
- `test-arrange-act-assert` — Follow AAA pattern in every test.
- `test-no-implementation` — Test behavior, not implementation details.
- `test-mock-boundaries` — Only mock external boundaries (API, DB, filesystem).

### supabase-rls

Supabase Row Level Security patterns.

**Rules:**
- `supa-rls-required` — Every table must have RLS policies before merging.
- `supa-auth-context` — Use `auth.uid()` in RLS policies. Never trust client-side filters alone.
- `supa-service-role` — Never expose the service role key to the client.

## Block Source

Blocks are distributed inside the npm package in `content/blocks/`. Each block is a YAML file with an `id`, `name`, `description`, `version`, and a list of `rules` with scope assignments.
