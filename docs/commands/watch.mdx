---

```bash
devw watch
```

Watches your `.dwf/` directory and recompiles automatically whenever a rule file changes. This keeps your editor config files always in sync without running `devw compile` manually.

## What it watches

All `.yml` and `.yaml` files inside `.dwf/`, including:

- `.dwf/config.yml`
- `.dwf/rules/**/*.yml`

## Behavior

1. Runs an initial compile on startup
2. Watches `.dwf/` for file changes (add, edit, delete)
3. Debounces rapid changes into a single recompile
4. Prints per-bridge results after each compile
5. Errors are printed but never stop the watch process
6. `Ctrl+C` exits cleanly

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--tool claude` | Recompile only a specific bridge |

## Output

### On change

```
⟳ Change detected: .dwf/rules/conventions.yml
Compiling...
✔ claude     → CLAUDE.md
✔ cursor     → .cursor/rules/devworkflows.mdc
✔ gemini     → GEMINI.md
Done in 42ms
```

### On error

```
✖ Duplicate rule id "react-no-inline-styles"

```

## Examples

```bash
# Watch all configured tools
devw watch

# Watch only Claude bridge
devw watch --tool claude
```
