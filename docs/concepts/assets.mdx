Assets extend dev-workflows beyond rules. They are static files (Markdown, JSON) that get placed in specific directories during compilation.

## Asset Types

### Commands

Slash commands are Markdown files with prompts that AI editors (like Claude Code) can execute via `/command-name`.

```bash
devw add command/spec
devw compile
# → .claude/commands/spec.md
```

Commands are stored in `.dwf/assets/commands/` and deployed to `.claude/commands/` with frontmatter stripped.

**Available commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `command/spec` | Generate a feature spec through guided questions |
| `command/plan` | Create an implementation plan from a spec |
| `command/build` | Execute a plan step by step with verification |
| `command/learn` | Capture a lesson learned as a project rule |

### Templates

Templates are Markdown files that provide structure for documents like feature specs.

```bash
devw add template/feature-spec
devw compile
# → docs/specs/feature-spec.md
```

Templates are stored in `.dwf/assets/templates/` and deployed to the path specified in their `output_path` frontmatter field (defaults to `docs/specs/`).

**Available templates:**

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `template/feature-spec` | Markdown template for feature specifications |

### Hooks

Hooks are JSON files that configure editor behavior (e.g., auto-formatting after edits).

```bash
devw add hook/auto-format
devw compile
# → .claude/settings.local.json (deep-merged)
```

Hooks are stored in `.dwf/assets/hooks/` and their `settings` object is deep-merged into `.claude/settings.local.json`. Arrays are concatenated, objects are recursively merged.

**Available hooks:**

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hook/auto-format` | Auto-format files after AI edits (PostToolUse) |

### Presets

Presets are YAML manifests that bundle multiple rules and assets into a single install.

```bash
devw add preset/spec-driven
```

This installs all rules, commands, templates, and hooks listed in the preset.

**Available presets:**

| Preset | Includes |
|--------|----------|
| `preset/spec-driven` | `workflow/spec-driven` rule, 4 commands (spec, plan, build, learn), feature-spec template, auto-format hook |

## Asset Lifecycle

1. **Install**: `devw add command/spec` downloads the file to `.dwf/assets/commands/spec.md` and records it in `config.yml`
2. **Deploy**: `devw compile` copies the file (stripping frontmatter) to the output location
3. **Remove**: `devw remove command/spec` deletes the source file and removes the config entry
4. **Verify**: `devw doctor` checks that all registered assets have corresponding files on disk

## Config Format

Assets are tracked in `.dwf/config.yml`:

```yaml
assets:
  - type: command
    name: spec
    version: 0.1.0
    installed_at: "2026-02-20T00:00:00Z"
  - type: template
    name: feature-spec
    version: 0.1.0
    installed_at: "2026-02-20T00:00:00Z"
  - type: hook
    name: auto-format
    version: 0.1.0
    installed_at: "2026-02-20T00:00:00Z"
```

The `assets` field is optional and backwards-compatible. Configs without it default to an empty array.
