```bash
devw add [category/name]
```

Adds rules and assets from the official dev-workflows registry. Supports both interactive and direct modes.

## Interactive Mode

Running `devw add` without arguments launches an interactive flow:

1. Browse categories from the registry
2. Select rules to install (with back navigation)
3. Optionally add rules from multiple categories
4. Review a summary and confirm
5. Rules are downloaded, converted to YAML, and compiled

Rules already installed are shown with an `(already installed)` indicator.

## Direct Mode

```bash
devw add typescript/strict       # add a rule
devw add command/spec            # add a slash command
devw add template/feature-spec   # add a spec template
devw add hook/auto-format        # add an editor hook
devw add preset/spec-driven      # add a preset (bundle)
```

Downloads and installs a specific rule or asset by path. If the rule already exists at the same version, reports "Already up to date".

## Asset Types

The `category` prefix determines the type:

| Prefix | Type | Destination |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `command/` | Slash command | `.dwf/assets/commands/` → `.claude/commands/` |
| `template/` | Spec template | `.dwf/assets/templates/` → `docs/specs/` |
| `hook/` | Editor hook | `.dwf/assets/hooks/` → `.claude/settings.local.json` |
| `preset/` | Bundle | Installs multiple rules + assets at once |
| _anything else_ | Rule | `.dwf/rules/` → editor configs |

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--list [category]` | List available rules from the registry |
| `--no-compile` | Skip auto-compile after adding |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing rules without asking |
| `--dry-run` | Show output without writing files |

## Examples

```bash
# Interactive — browse and select rules
devw add

# Install a specific rule
devw add typescript/strict

# Install a slash command
devw add command/spec

# Install a full workflow preset
devw add preset/spec-driven

# List all available rules

# Preview what would be written
