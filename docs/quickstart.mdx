## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22

## Install and Initialize

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize your project">
    ```bash
    npx dev-workflows init
    ```
    This creates a `.dwf/` directory with `config.yml` and empty rule files for each scope: architecture, conventions, security, testing, and workflow.

    The CLI detects existing AI tools in your project (CLAUDE.md, .cursor/, GEMINI.md) and pre-selects them.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add rules from the registry (optional)">
    ```bash
    npx dev-workflows add typescript/strict
    ```
    Installs rules from the GitHub registry into your `.dwf/rules/` directory. Run `devw add --list` to see all available rules, or `devw add` for interactive selection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compile">
    ```bash
    npx dev-workflows compile
    ```
    Generates editor-specific config files:

    | Tool | Output |
    |------|--------|
    | Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
    | Cursor | `.cursor/rules/devworkflows.mdc` |
    | Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` |
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What's Next

- Write your own rules in `.dwf/rules/` → [Rules format](/concepts/rules)
- Validate your setup → `devw doctor`
- Browse all commands → [Commands](/commands/init)
