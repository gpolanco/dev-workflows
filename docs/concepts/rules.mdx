description: "How to write and organize rules in dev-workflows"
---

Rules are the core of dev-workflows. Each rule is a piece of guidance for AI editors, written in natural language and stored in YAML.

## File Structure

Rules live in `.dwf/rules/`, organized by scope:

```
.dwf/rules/
  architecture.yml
  conventions.yml
  security.yml
  testing.yml
  workflow.yml
```

## Rule Format

```yaml
scope: conventions

rules:
  - id: named-exports
    severity: error
    content: |
      Always use named exports. Never use default exports.
      This applies to all files: components, utilities, hooks, and types.

  - id: no-barrel-files
    severity: warning
    content: |
      Avoid barrel files (index.ts re-exports).
      Import directly from the source file.
```

## Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | Unique identifier (kebab-case) |
| `severity` | enum | No | `error` \| `warning` \| `info` (default: `error`) |
| `content` | string | Yes | The rule in natural language (multiline YAML) |
| `tags` | string[] | No | Tags for filtering |
| `enabled` | boolean | No | Default: `true`. Disable without deleting |

## Severity Behavior

- **error** and **warning** rules are included in compiled output
- **info** rules are internal documentation only — they are omitted from output
- Rules with `enabled: false` are always omitted

## Scopes

The five built-in scopes organize rules by concern:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `architecture` | Project structure, patterns, module organization |
| `conventions` | Naming, formatting, code style |
| `security` | Auth, RLS, secrets, input validation |
| `testing` | Test strategy, naming, coverage |
| `workflow` | Git, CI/CD, PR process, deployment |
