title: "Output Modes"
description: "Copy mode vs link mode, and how markers protect your content"
---

dev-workflows supports two output modes, configured during `devw init` or in `.dwf/config.yml`.

## Copy Mode (default)

```yaml
mode: copy
```

Writes compiled content directly into the target files. This is the simplest and recommended mode.

## Link Mode

```yaml
mode: link
```

Writes compiled files to `.dwf/.cache/` and creates symlinks from the expected output paths. Useful if you want a single source of truth without duplicating content.

When using link mode, `.dwf/.cache/` is automatically added to `.gitignore`.

## Markers

When compiling to CLAUDE.md or GEMINI.md, the generated content is wrapped in markers:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN dev-workflows -->
# Project Rules

## Conventions

- Always use named exports.

<!-- END dev-workflows -->
```

If you have **manual content** outside the markers, it is preserved on recompile. This lets you keep hand-written rules alongside generated ones.

The Cursor bridge (`.mdc` file) does not use markers — the entire file is managed by dev-workflows.
